   ```
   python bot.py --token=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN

   python bot.py
   ```

3. The first user to interact with the bot will automatically become an admin

### Server Deployment

For deployment on a server, you can use the included `deploy.sh` script:

1. Transfer all files to your server (e.g., using scp or git)
2. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ```
3. Run the deployment script as root with your bot token (required):
   ```
   sudo ./deploy.sh --token=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
   ```

By default, the deployment runs in automated mode without any prompts.

#### Interactive Deployment

If you prefer to be prompted for confirmations during deployment, use the interactive mode:

```
sudo ./deploy.sh --token=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN --interactive
```

This mode will:
- Prompt you for confirmation at each key step
